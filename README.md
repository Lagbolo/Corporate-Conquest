# CORPORATE CONQUEST

Computer programming 12 collaborative final project. Credit to CrimsonBlade for working on this with me a couple of years ago.

This is a 2D dungeon crawler roguelike set in an office building. 
The goal is to progress to the top floor and defeat the CEO by beating the coworkers and managers on each floor. 
Each floor you can upgrade yourself and your gear as your competition becomes tougher and tougher the higher you climb on the corporate ladder. 
Crush your enemies and rise to the top to overthrow the corrupt CEO and rule Money Co.!
